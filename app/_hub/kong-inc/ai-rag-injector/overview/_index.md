The AI RAG Injector plugin simplifies the creation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines by automatically injecting content from a vector database of choice on the existing requests.

This plugin provides the following benefits:
* Improves productivity and accelerates creating RAG pipelines, as you don't have to build the semantic association.
* Lets you lock down sensitive vector databases, so that developers don't have direct access. AI Gateway becomes the client, instead of the developer applications.
* Enables building RAG pipelines in more places, even in places where connectivity to the vector database was originally not possible.
