title: Content templates
---

At Kong, we use the following four standard content types when we write our documentation:

* Explanation: Documentation that is understanding-oriented because it clarifies and discusses a particular topic.
* Workflow: Narrative-driven documentation that guides users through specific steps to complete a real-world problem. This content can be goal-oriented and learning-oriented.
* Reference: Documentation that explains the technology, like API or command line documentation.

To help anyone interested in writing documentation, we have created templates for the individual content types:

- [Explanation](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/explanation-template.md)
- [Reference](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/reference-template.md)
- [Workflow](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/tutorial-template.md)

Plugin documentation follows its own specific format, regardless of content type:
* Template for [Kong-owned plugins](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/kong-plugin-template)
* Template for [partner plugins](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/partner-plugin-template)
