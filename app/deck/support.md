## Konnect

decK is an officially supported way to configure {{ site.konnect_short_name }} deployments. **The minimum version required to configure Konnect is decK v1.40.0**.

The {{ site.konnect_short_name }} API returns the most recent {{ site.base_gateway }} API response. If you experiencing issues with decK and {{ site.konnect_short_name }}, please update to the latest available version.

## On-Prem

decK guarantees compatibility with all supported {{ site.base_gateway }} versions.

Changes to {{ site.base_gateway }} may result in changes to decK, and we encourage consumers to update decK regularly as the most recent version will work with both old versions of {{ site.base_gateway }} _and_ the latest version simultaneously.
